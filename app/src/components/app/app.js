I told her we were having the well installed and she was relieved that she wouldn\'t have to go scare the off with her shotgun. After resolving the case of the "intruders" she told us she missed us and that we should come over and take some of her blueberries this weekend. We visited for over an hour on Saturday night, drank beer, and ate the most delicious blueberries until my tummy ached. Now I can\'t get the idea of a weekly card/domino game night with them out of my head. #tinytwohomestead',
